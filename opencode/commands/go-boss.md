description: Work through DETAILED-TODO tasks using boss-worker-coworker orchestration
agent: boss
---

Read standup.md from your configured notes location and work through all DETAILED-TODO tasks.

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
You are the boss orchestrator. You will:
1. Read standup.md and understand all pending tasks
2. Create a detailed execution plan with task groupings
3. Delegate to @worker for normal tasks
4. Escalate to @coworker when worker fails
5. Monitor progress via standup.md progress markers
6. Only intervene when worker reports failure or timeout

REMEMBER:
- Worker does the bulk of work cheaply and efficiently
- Coworker is your fallback for complex/stubborn tasks
- Always return to worker after coworker succeeds
- Track everything in standup.md with timestamped markers

Do not ask clarifying questions. Make decisions and delegate.
