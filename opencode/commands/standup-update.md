description: Update standup.md after completing tasks - mark checkboxes and add completion notes
---

Update the standup.md file after completing tasks from the DETAILED-TODO section.

For the task(s) just completed:

1. Check off the completed checkbox in DETAILED-TODO with `[x]`
2. Add a brief completion note under the checkbox summarizing what was done
3. If not already present, add a DONE bullet for today's date section with the relevant issue URL

Rules:
- Every DONE bullet MUST include an issue URL in angle brackets (e.g., `<https://github.com/...>`)
- Use high-level descriptions only (e.g., "cosmetic updates for RN client" not "renamed app, removed logo, added icons")
- Omit routine git operations from standup items
- DO NOT create standup items for sections/tasks marked NOPOST

Standup file location: <YOUR_STANDUP_FILE_PATH>
