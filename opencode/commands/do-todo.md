description: Work through DETAILED-TODO tasks autonomously across all repos
---

Perform all tasks in the DETAILED-TODO section of standup.md.

Execution rules:
1. Read standup.md in your notes directory
2. For each repo section, check that repo's AGENTS.md first
3. Work through ALL tasks across ALL sections continuously without stopping
4. DO NOT skip NOPOST sections - execute them, just don't create standup/issues for them
5. Only pause at the very end to present a consolidated summary

For each completed task:
- Check off the item in DETAILED-TODO with `[x]`
- Add a brief completion summary under the checkbox describing what was done
- Commit updates in the respective repo
- Update relevant gh issue (check checkboxes, add concise comment)
- Open the gh issue thread in Safari immediately after updating
- When posting in gh discussion, also open the discussion thread in Safari immediately too
- Update today's DONE section with the issue link

Real-time updates:
- When re-reading standup.md, check for new tasks added after reviews
- Go do newly added tasks without stopping

File creation:
- Create temp/working files in the current repo folder, not elsewhere
